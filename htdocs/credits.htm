<p>FreeRTOS V.7.3.0 used

<pre>
The FreeRTOS.org source code is licensed by the *modified* GNU General Public
License (GPL), text provided below.  A special exception to the GPL is 
included to allow you to distribute a combined work that includes FreeRTOS 
without being obliged to provide the source code for any proprietary 
components.  See the licensing section of http://www.FreeRTOS.org for full 
details.  The exception text is also included at the bottom of this file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GPL license text follows. 
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, Version 2, June 1991, see http://www.gnu.org
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FreeRTOS GPL Exception Text:

Any FreeRTOS source code, whether modified or in it's original release form, 
or whether in whole or in part, can only be distributed by you under the terms 
of the GNU General Public License plus this exception. An independent module is 
a module which is not derived from or based on FreeRTOS.

Clause 1:

Linking FreeRTOS statically or dynamically with other modules is making a 
combined work based on FreeRTOS. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU 
General Public License cover the whole combination.

As a special exception, the copyright holder of FreeRTOS gives you permission 
to link FreeRTOS with independent modules that communicate with FreeRTOS 
solely through the FreeRTOS API interface, regardless of the license terms of 
these independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting combined 
work under terms of your choice, provided that

  + Every copy of the combined work is accompanied by a written statement that 
  details to the recipient the version of FreeRTOS used and an offer by yourself 
  to provide the FreeRTOS source code (including any modifications you may have 
  made) should the recipient request it.

  + The combined work is not itself an RTOS, scheduler, kernel or related product.

  + The independent modules add significant and primary functionality to FreeRTOS 
  and do not merely extend the existing functionality already present in FreeRTOS.

Clause 2:

FreeRTOS may not be used for any competitive or comparative purpose, including the 
publication of any form of run time or compile time metric, without the express 
permission of Real Time Engineers Ltd. (this is the norm within the industry and 
is intended to ensure information accuracy).
